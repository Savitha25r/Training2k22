WEB API : ASP.Net Web API is an extensible framework for building REST ful services that can be accessed from any client such as browsers, mobile devices,IOTs

REST stands for Representational State Transfer
It is an architectural pattern used for data exchange over a distributed environment.
It works solely on HTTP based services.

Get
Post -FromBody or FromURL
Put- update all columns/data
Patch - update few data/columns
Delete 1. soft delete, where we need to update a column like status/remarks etc
       2. hard delete, where the entire record is removed from the persistent storage

From To
Date of onward
date of return 

Sent -> REST -> XML/JSON

The REST Pattern specifies a set of constraints
1. Client-Server Constraint: No dependency on each other. Seperation of concern that makes it easy for development and maintenence. A client should only know the URI's

2. Stateless Constraint: Communication between client and server should be stateless, meaning server should not store any details of client. This helps to treat every request independently

3. Cachable Constraint : When the servers master data that does not undergo changes frequently, then it can be chached at the client for as long as the client wishes to have it.

4. Uniform Interface Constraint : All resources that miove between client and server are only using HTTP verbs


5. Content Negotiation : Client ha sthe ability to dcide in which format it wants the response (XML/JSON)

6. Layered System: Having the UI, Businees Logic, Data Access logic all seperated either as different folders/applications


Attribute Routing : is a customized way to access action methods inside a controller

The entry in the routing table will be made with the route name rather the http verb name
