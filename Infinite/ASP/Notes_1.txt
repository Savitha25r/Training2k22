ASP.Net : Is a web development platform, which provides a programming model, comprehensive software infrastructure and various services required to build robut web applications for PC, as well as mobile devices

Other Technologies to build web applications

.PHP
.Java
.CGI
.Perl
.Ruby on Rails

All web applications have to be hosted on a web server
   -IIS 
   -Tomcat
   -Apache
   -Websphere

-Only Browser is required on the client machine to access the web application
-Accesible from anywhere, with internet
-Work on a client/server architecture

Web Form/Page :
  has  2 files viz designerfile and code behind file
 code behind file has an extension of either aspx.cs or aspx.vb
designer file contains extension of aspx.designer.cs or aspx.designer.vb
- A web form is associated with its code file using the @page directive

S - Start the page
I - Initialization (all controls are initialized)
L - Load
V - Validate
E - Event Handling
R - Render (Css/styles/UI is applied)

Page Events : 
Pre-Init
Init
InitComplete
OnPreLoad
Load
LoadComplete
OnPreRender
Render
Unload

Application Life Cycle :

ApplicationStart
ObjectCreation
HttpApplication 
   HttpContext
   Request
   Response
Dispose
ApplicationEnd

Inline Code
Code Behind

Trace : is like a debugger which traces all the request and response activities. We should enable the trace in the web.config file

<system.web>
<trace enabled="true"/>
....
...
</system.web>

When we enable trace, we will have a file with trace.axd created.


Validations : Using built in Validation Controls
we can have the basic validation getting executed through the client side javascripts.

Note : Set the unobtrusive mode value to none in web.config file inorder to have the javascripts executed
